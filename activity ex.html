Brisk walking is an ideal exercise for human and hound. The benefits include a stronger heart, lower blood pressure, more energy, denser bones, and a lower risk of depression. In dogs, regular walks can also reduce common behavior problems. There's no set rule for how far or how long a dog should walk.</p>
<h3><i>FOR CATS!!</i></h3> 
<p>Cats love to lounge, regular exercise and play is crucial to their overall health. Whether you already have a routine or are just starting one, remember that your activities should tap into your cat’s natural instincts. There are so many ways to play with your cat, and finding what they love will help keep them active and happy for many years to come.</p>

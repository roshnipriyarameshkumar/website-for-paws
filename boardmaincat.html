 Cat boarding is basically dropping off your cat at a trusted pet sitter's place so they can take care of your pet. However, you should not confuse it with traditional boarding where cats are dropped off at a facility where many other cats are also housed.Cats are so independent and easily frightened into hiding, they benefit much more from a controlled environment where they can be closely monitored
ringing your cat to a facility is becoming all the rage, and many owners see how much better their cat does more quality enrichment and care by cat experts.</p>
